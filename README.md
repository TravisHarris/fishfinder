"myfishfinder" is a stand-alone application to filter out fish that are not applicaple in any cases and therefore just taking up space, bandwidth, and processing time. It is not part of the application itself.

How To:

  1. Input your level, this is needed to determine which fish are available to you.
  
  2. Input your budget, to determine how many of the prospective fish you can buy and to determine your profits.
  
  3. Input the number of tanks you will be using, tanks can only hold 250 fish each and you can only own (your level + 1) total non-deluxe        tanks at a time, if you have any deluxe tanks this could essentially be any number. If you are using Super-Gro and this number you        input larger than 1 for tanks it will be overwritten as we assume you are only Super-Gro'ing one tank at a time.
  
  4. If you are using Super-Gro check the Super-Gro checkbox, this will overwrite the number of tanks you have to 1 as it assumes you are      only Super-Gro'ing one tank at a time. It will also remove your ability to choose a timeframe(fishes Adult Age Time) and disregard        any previously selected value. As the time will be instant.
  
  5. If you are not using Super-Gro, you can select how long you would like to wait for your fish to reach adult age.
  
  6. Press "Find Fish" to generate the most profitable fish given the situation.
  
  7. In-game on Fish World, go to The Shop and find your fish by typing it's name in the search box.
  
  8. PROFIT!!!
